# Simple-Slot-Machine-Python
This is a simple slot machine game I built to practice Python programming. I followed a tutorial by Tech With Tim on YouTube to learn the core concepts.

The program simulates a slot machine where players can deposit money, bet on multiple lines, and spin the reels. The outcome of each spin determines if the player wins or loses money. 

The code is structured using functions for better organization:

- deposit(): Prompts the user to enter a deposit amount.
- get_number_of_lines(): Allows the player to choose the number of lines to bet on.
- get_bet(): Gets the betting amount for each line.
- spin(): Handles the actual spinning of the slot machine, calculates winnings, and updates the balance.
- get_slot_machine_spin(): Generates random symbols for the slot machine.
- print_slot_machine(): Displays the slot machine's symbols.
- check_winnings(): Determines if there are any winning lines and calculates winnings.

The main game loop continues until the player decides to quit.
 
Overall, this project helped me practice using functions, loops, conditional statements, and basic input/output operations in Python.
