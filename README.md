# Simple-Slot-Machine-Python
This is a simple slot machine game I built to practice Python programming. I followed a tutorial by Tech With Tim on YouTube to learn the core concepts.  The program simulates a slot machine where players can deposit money, bet on multiple lines, and spin the reels. The outcome of each spin determines if the player wins or loses money.
